# Kotlin-Java

server application

Javalin is a true microframework with only two dependencies: the embedded web-server (Jetty) and a logging facade (SLF4J).

Javalin has plugins for JSON mapping, template rendering, and OpenAPI (Swagger), but theyâ€™re optional dependencies that you have to add manually.

You can exclude the Jetty dependency if you want to run Javalin on a different servlet container.
