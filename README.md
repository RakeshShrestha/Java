Java >= 1.8.0_252

kotlinapp is a Javalin (MicroFramework Service Oriented Architecture) based rest api server application.

Javalin has automated plugins for JSON mapping, Web Sockets, template rendering, and OpenAPI (Swagger).

As to me it's better than spark framework.

This codebase demonstrates implementation of crud operations, authentication, routing, pagination, unit test and openapi (partial).

Full OpenApi or Swagger automated documentation of implemented api and parameters can be put adding some extra lines of code only. 

This we normally enable in demo app not operational app.
